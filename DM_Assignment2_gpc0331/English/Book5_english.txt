The odd account of the origin of this Treatise--in its first
lines--caught my eye as I was turning over the leaves of the Sloane
Manuscript which contains it. I resolved to print it as a specimen of
the curious fancies our forefathers believed in (as I suppose) in
Natural Science, to go alongside of the equally curious notions they
put faith in in matters religious. And this I determined on with no idea
of scoffing, or pride in modern wisdom; for I believe that as great
fallacies now prevail in both the great branches of knowledge and
feeling mentioned, as ever were held by man. Because once held by other
men, and specially by older Englishmen, these fancies and notions have,
or should have, an interest for all of us; and in this belief, one of
them is presented here.

The loss of my sweet, bright, only child, Eena, and other distress, have
prevented my getting up any cram on the subject of Quintessence to form
a regular Preface. The (translated?) original of the text is attributed
to Hermes--Trismegistus, “or the thrice great Interpreter,” so called as
“having three parts of the Philosophy of the whole world”[1]--to whom
were credited more works than he wrote. The tract appears to be a great
fuss about Alcohol or Spirits of Wine; how to make it, and get more or
less tipsy on it, and what wonders it will work, from making old men
young, and dying men well, to killing lice.

The reading of the proof with the MS. was done by Mr. Edmund Brock, the
Society’s most careful and able helper. To Mr. Cockayne I am indebted
for the identification of some names of plants, &c.; and to Mr. Gill
of University College, London, for some Notes on the Chemistry of the
treatise, made at the request of my friend Mr. Moreshwar Atmaram.[2] The
Sloane MS. I judge to be about, but after, 1460 A.D.[3] The later copy
(Harleian MS. 853, fol. 66) seems late 16th century or early 17th,[3]
and has been only collated for a few passages which require elucidation.
The pause marks of the MS. and text require to be disregarded
occasionally in reading.

    EGHAM, _16th May, 1866_.

P.S. The short side-notes in inverted commas on and after p. 16 (save
‘5 M^e’ and the like) are by a later hand in the MS. The ‘Spheres’ on
p. 26, and the ‘Contents,’ p. vii-viii, are now added.--F. 1889.

                     NOTES

          ON THE CHEMISTRY OF THE TEXT

By C. H. GILL, Esq., of University College, London


P. 4. Direction to submit any wine _that is not sour_ to distillation.
(_Sour_ wine is deficient in alcohol; that body having been changed into
acetic acid by oxidation.) In the language of the mystical ideas which
prevailed in the dawn of Chemistry, the colouring matters, sugar, &c. of
the wine are called ‘the .4. elementis,’ or as it were the ‘rotten fæces
of wine’??

The direction to distill the wine seven times is a good practical
suggestion for the obtaining of strong alcohol which will burn well.
Then follows a description of the distilling apparatus, which seems to
have been arranged to ensure a very slow distillation, so as to obtain a
product as colourless and scentless as possible.

P. 5. The second way to make the Quinte essence depends on distillation
of alcohol by means of the heat of fermenting horse-dung; also the fifth
manner.

P. 6. The directions for gilding burning water are all nonsense; but as
the writer had no means of testing the truth of his statements, they may
have been made in good faith.

P. 7. The idea which he expresses, that this gilt burning water will
make you well and young, is difficult to explain, except on the
assumption that, it being the strongest of alcohol, a very little served
to produce that elevation of spirits which seemed to bring back the
spring of youth.

P. 7, l. 6 from the bottom. The word _liquibles_ in the text does not
mean liquids, for a liquid cannot be made hot enough to be _quenched_.
If the original _liquibles_ cannot be retained I should substitute the
word _liquiables_, meaning those things which can be liquefied by heat.
Indeed in the next passage we find stated that if Saturn (the
alchemists’ mystical name for Lead) be quenched, &c., and that if then
Mars (Iron) be quenched in the same liquid, it will acquire the softness
of Saturn. Or if you quench lead in spirit which has had iron first
cooled in it, it becomes hard.

Of course there is no truth whatever in the above statements.

P. 8. The fire without coals, &c., is ‘corrosive sublimate,’ most
probably containing an excess of Sulphuric acid (vitriol) as an
impurity. If Copper (Venus) or Tin (Jupiter) be dipt into this solution
of mercury they will have a deposit of mercury formed on their surface,
which will give them a pearly appearance.

P. 8. To bring Gold into calx. When gold is treated in the way directed,
a fine powder of gold of a brown or yellow colour is left. This might
readily have been mistaken for a calx by those who had no clear ideas of
what calx really was.

P. 9. The departing of gold from silver is essentially the same as the
plan practised at the present day.

To get the Quintessence of Gold. I can make nothing of the directions,
that is, I cannot see that they (the directions) hide any real truth.

P. 10. How to get the Quintessence of Antimony. I can make nothing of
this part, and can only suggest that the vinegar used contained
hydrochloric acid, and when distilled with ‘Myn Antimony’ (native
sulphide of antimony) gave a distillate of Chloride of Antimony
containing some ‘kermes’ which is red.

From this point onward there is little or nothing that can be explained

The superfluous “e” and the comma after “Brit” appear to be the only
typographical errors in the book.

Each page of body text was surrounded by the following:

Top of Page:
  Synopsis of page contents. This e-text preserves the page breaks and
  line divisions of the 1866/1889 book.

Inner Margin:
  Line numbers in increments of 4, used for Index.

  Footnotes, originally numbered from 1 on each page.

Outer Margin:
  Side footnotes: Identified by asterisk rather than by number. In this
  e-text they are printed directly below the referring line, in the same
  way as page-bottom footnotes.

  Folio number: Marked with an asterisk at the exact point of page break.
  It appears to be mere coincidence that the text of folio (leaf) 26 was
  printed on page 26 of the 1889 book.

  Marginal notations: These are described in the “P.S.” of the editor’s
  introduction.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
